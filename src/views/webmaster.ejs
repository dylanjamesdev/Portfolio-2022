              Back in 1993, you weren't a designer, developer, copywriter or in
              devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your name was at the
              bottom of every page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's talk about that.
              <strong
                >Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.
              </strong>
              The domain might have said
              <a href="http://tomstrucking.net/">tomstrucking.net </a>, but it
              was built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a
              question, you emailed
              <a href="mailto:webmaster@tomstrucking.net"
                >webmaster@tomstrucking.net </a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>And that address got a lot of emails:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                "Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site."
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                "Can you put a hit counter on my web page?"
                <br />
              </li>
              <li>
                "I want my headline to be
                <span class="blink">blinking </span>."
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Folks treated webmasters like goddamned magicians. Just email us
              with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll make them a reality.
            </p>
            <p>

                >We couldn't draw, but we harnessed simple design patterns and
                made them work.
                <br />
                We weren't engineers, but we could bend a CGI script to our
                will.
                <br />
                We weren't writers, but we discovered that words were the core
                of every page.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.</p>
            <p>
              What did we love? The
              <span class="third-degree">VARIETY </span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              People would come to us with a
              <strong>problem </strong>, and we would figure out a
              <strong>solution </strong>. We couldn't just search the web
              <strong>because the web was still being written </strong>. And you
              couldn't just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk
              next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility
              closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 90s, and webmasters came in all sorts of flavors. Some were
              IT people. Others came from the print world. Many worked in
              academia. There was a group that was more artsy fartsy (musicians,
              painters, writers). And&nbsp;there were&nbsp;
              <a href="http://nerdmullet.com/">snot-nosed kids </a> tying up
              their parents' landlines with dial-up modems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite our diversity, we had a shared skill:
              <strong>we knew how to make a website. </strong> This, as it turns
              out, is pretty fucking fantastic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sure, you could charge someone and build them a website. But even
              better,
              <strong>you could make your own website. </strong> You'd publish
              whatever you were passionate about:
              <a href="https://www.spork.org/">sporks </a>,
              <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/">whiskey </a>,
              or your hatred of
              <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html"
                >Internet Explorer </a
              >. Crazy enough: you put that stuff online, and you'd meet other
              folks who liked the same damn thing. And all you really needed was
              a text editor (and maybe an FTP client). If webmasters were
              magicians than the web was our magic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our websites were pretty damned ugly. Instead of worrying about
              window dressing, we focused on
              <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html">words </a>,
              hierarchy, and structure. Each new page started in a text editor
              looking something like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
<code style="color: grey">&lt;h1&gt;What's this fucking page about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what this fucking page is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href="#"&gt;go here, fucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>
            <p>
              Sure, it was simple, but it was focused. No distractions, just:
              what idea are you trying to express?
            </p>
            <p>
              We've seen lots of cool shit built on the web, but we've also seen
              lots of bullshit too: barriers to entry, walled gardens,
              gatekeepers. Some things have been made unnecessarily complex.
              <strong>At its core a web page is simple. </strong>
              That's the beauty of it. And when you publish HTML to a server
              that you control; that's fucking powerful. Autonomy and
              independence are central to the web. We can't forget that.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The world still needs some fucking webmasters. </strong>
              We might not all be making websites
              <em>professionally </em> anymore. But we should keep making
              websites. The passion, the freedom, the joy: we need to pass this
              on.
