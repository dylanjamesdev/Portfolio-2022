            <h1>This is a web page.</h1>
            <p>There's not much here.</p>
            <p>Just words.</p>
            <p><strong>And you're reading them.</strong></p>
            <p>
              We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and
              scripts that do magical things.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote these words, and you're reading them:
              <em>that's</em> magical.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm in a little city in Florida; you're probably somewhere else. I
              wrote this early in the morning, August 25th, 2022; you're reading
              it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be
              reading this on your phone, a tablet or a desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and I have been able to connect because<em> I wrote this </em
              >and <em>you're reading it.</em> <strong>That's the web</strong>.
              Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can
              connect <em>here, </em>on a simple HTML page.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6&nbsp;kB. I didn't need a
              Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software
              developer. There's not much code on this page at all: just simple
              markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.
            </p>
            <p><strong>You are still reading.</strong></p>
            <p>
              Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple
              page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell
              something. If you're a teacher, you could teach something. If
              you're an artist, you could show something you've made.
              <strong
                >And if your words are good, people will read them.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words
              first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop
              mockup,
              <em>start with words on a page</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use
              in adding all that other cruft.
              <strong>Just start with one page</strong>, with a single focus.
              Write it and publish it, and then <em>iterate on that</em>. Every
              time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help
              me communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or
              hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer is
              "no," don't add it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>At its heart, web design should be about words</strong>.
              Words don't come <em>after</em> the design is done. Words are the
              beginning, the core, the focus.
            </p>
            <p>Start with words.</p>
