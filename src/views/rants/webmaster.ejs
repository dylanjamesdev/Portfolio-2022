                Back in the early 2000's, you weren't a designer, developer,
                copywriter or in devops. You were a fucking webmaster, and your
                name was at the bottom of every page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's talk about that.
                <strong
                        >Your name was in the footer of every fucking page.
                </strong>
                The domain might have said
                <a href="http://dylanjames.gay">dylanjames.gay
                </a>, but it was
                built, hosted, and maintained by one person. If you had a
                question, you emailed
                <a href="mailto:webmaster@dylanjames.gay"
                   >webmaster@dylanjames.gay
                </a
                  >.
              </p>
              <p>And that address got a lot of emails:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Please play the Star Trek theme when people get to my site."
                <br />
                "Can you put a hit counter on my web page?"
                <br />
                "I want my headline to be blinking."
              </p>
              <p>
                Folks treated webmasters like goddamned magicians. Just email us
                with your cyberspace dreams, and we'll make them a reality.

                  We weren't engineers, but we could bend a CGI script to our
                  will.
                  <br />
                  We weren't writers, but we discovered that words were the core
                  of every page.
                </em>
              </p>
              <p>In the process of doing all these things, we fell in love.

                People would come to us with a
                <strong>problem 
                </strong>, and we would figure out a
                <strong>solution 
                </strong>. We couldn't just search the web
                <strong>because the web was still being written 
                </strong>. And you
                couldn't just punt a hard question to the engineer in the desk
                next to you. Why? Because you were sitting alone in a utility
                closet packed with floppy disks and old tape drives.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 2000s, and webmasters came in all sorts of flavors. Some
                were IT people. Others came from the print world. Many worked in
                academia. There was a group that was more artsy fartsy (musicians,
                painters, writers). And&nbsp;there were&nbsp; snot-nosed kids
                tying up their parents' landlines with dial-up modems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite our diversity, we had a shared skill:
                <strong>we knew how to make a website. 
                </strong> This, as it turns
                out, is pretty fucking fantastic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sure, you could charge someone and build them a website. But even
                better,
                <strong>you could make your own website. 
                </strong> You'd publish
                whatever you were passionate about:
                <a href="https://www.spork.org/">sporks 
                </a>,
                <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jhb/whisky/">whiskey 
                </a>,
                or your hatred of
                <a href="http://toastytech.com/evil/index.html"
                   >Internet Explorer 
                </a
                  >. Crazy enough: you put that stuff online, and you'd meet other
                folks who liked the same damn thing. And all you really needed was
                a text editor (and maybe an FTP client). If webmasters were
                magicians than the web was our magic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our websites were pretty damned ugly. Instead of worrying about
                window dressing, we focused on
                <a href="/words">words
                </a>, hierarchy, and structure. Each new
                page started in a text editor looking something like this:
              </p>
              <pre>
<code style="color: grey">&lt;h1&gt;What's this fucking page about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what this fucking page is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information &lt;a href="#"&gt;go here, fucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>
              <p>
                Sure, it was simple, but it was focused. No distractions, just:
                what idea are you trying to express?
              </p>
              <p>
                We've seen lots of cool shit built on the web, but we've also seen
                lots of bullshit too: barriers to entry, walled gardens,
                gatekeepers. Some things have been made unnecessarily complex.
                <strong>At its core a web page is simple. 
                </strong>
                That's the beauty of it. And when you publish HTML to a server
                that you control; that's fucking powerful. Autonomy and
                independence are central to the web. We can't forget that.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>The world still needs some fucking webmasters. 
                </strong>
                We might not all be making websites
                <em>professionally 
                </em> anymore. But we should keep making
                websites. The passion, the freedom, the joy: we need to pass this
                on.
